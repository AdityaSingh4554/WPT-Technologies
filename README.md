# JavaScript Functionality Examples

This repository showcases a variety of JavaScript functions, concepts, and implementations. It includes examples of anonymous functions, arrow functions, object manipulation, prototypes, inheritance, and more. The purpose is to provide a reference for learning and experimenting with JavaScript.

---

## Features

- **IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions):**
  Demonstrates functions executed as soon as they are defined.

- **Arrow Functions:**
  Compact syntax for writing functions, including examples like calculating squares and factorials.

- **Object Manipulation:**
  Examples of creating objects, assigning properties, and extending objects using `Object.assign` and the spread operator.

- **Prototype and Inheritance:**
  Showcases the use of prototypes, inheritance mechanisms, and custom class-like behaviors in JavaScript.

- **Strict Mode:**
  Illustrates the use of `"use strict"` for enforcing a stricter parsing and error handling.

- **Functions and Classes:**
  Examples of both parent and child classes, showcasing inheritance and method overriding.

## Code Structure

All examples are written within a `<script>` block to be run directly in a browser. To test these examples:
1. Copy the code into an HTML file inside a `<script>` tag.
2. Open the file in a web browser to see the output.
3. Check the browser's console for debug logs.

---

## Examples Included

1. **Basic IIFE usage**
2. **Anonymous function examples**
3. **Arrow function implementations**  
   - Factorial computation  
   - Check if a number is even or odd  
4. **Object and constructor examples**  
   - Creating objects using `Object.assign`  
   - Adding and displaying properties dynamically  
5. **Prototypal inheritance**  
   - Parent class methods shared by child classes  
6. **`Strict Mode` demonstration**  
   - Highlighting differences in function and constructor behavior
7. **ToString and Fullname Methods in Objects**

---

## Usage

To execute specific examples:
- Uncomment the desired code block in the `<script>` tag.
- Save the file and refresh the browser to see the output.

---

## Future Improvements

- Adding more examples on `async/await` and `Promises`.
- Integration with modern JavaScript frameworks (e.g., React, Vue.js).
- Adding ES6+ features such as `Modules`, `Set`, `Map`, and `WeakMap`.
